# Namaste React Basics

# Parcel

- Dev Build.
- Local Server.
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement.
- Using File watching algorithm written in C++ it does HMR.
- Faster Build - Using Cache.
- Image optimisation.
- Minification of files.
- Bundle all the files.
- Compress all the files.
- Consistent Hashing.
- Code Splitting.
- Differential bundling: Means when app is hosted it runs smoothly on older versions of browsers as well.
- Diagnostic Features- By giving us better error handling features.
- Tree Shaking Algo: Suppose we have 10 functions and we are using only 3, it will remove those extra 7 function to minify the code.
- Different build for dev and prod.

# JSX

- Attributes written in camel case
- if you write multiple lines: (<h1 id= "heading" className = "Root">this is react</h1>)

# React Components

- class based component -old
- Functional component - new(Basically nothing but js function that return some piece of jsx).
